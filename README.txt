1. WHAT IS EXO WORKFLOW
---------------------------------------------------
		Workflow: is the way of looking at and controlling the processes presented in an organization such as service provision or 
information processing, etc. It is an effective tool to use in times of crisis to make certain that the processes are efficient and 
effective with the purpose of better and more cost efficient organization.
	
2. HOW TO SET UP EXO WORKFLOW
---------------------------------------------------
eXo Workflow requires the Java 2 Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit version 5.x

2.1. Install Java SE 1.5 (Java Development Kit)
Based on JavaEE, our Workflow runs currently fine with version 1.5 so if you are using newer version, please download and install this 
version to make Workflow works fine. We will support newer version of Java very soon.

2.2. Download eXo Workflow version from: http://forge.objectweb.org/projects/exoplatform/

2.3. Unzip that package under a path that does not contain any space (in Windows).

2.4. Open a shell session and go to the bin/ directory that has just been extracted.

2.5. Then run the command :
	Windows:
		eXo.bat run
	Linux, Unix, Mac OS
	chmod u+x *.sh ./eXo run

2.6. Open your web browsers, now eXo Workflow can run on FireFox 2 or newer, Internet Explorer 6 or newer 
(we recommend using FireFox 3+ or Internet Explorer 7+ for the best result) 
and navigate to URL: http://localhost:8080/portal

2.7. When the page has been loaded, click "Login" on the top right corner. Specify the username "root" and the password "exo".
